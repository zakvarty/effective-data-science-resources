## Session Plan 

1. Assessment questions speed-run
2. Week in review 
3. Professional Guidelines  
4. What would you do?
5. Data anonymisation walk through (if time allows)

# Questions Speed-run 

## From the inbox:

<br>

### Do I need to test my code? 

I can't make you do it, but if I were sharing my work with someone then I'd like to know it works as I intended. 

<br>

### Thoughts on Scripting + LaTeX vs Quarto vs Rmd vs JuPyteR

See section 2.3 of the notes. Good points about user familiarity, in any case povide enough information for someone new to that ecosystem. 

## File Size Limits
 
Large datasets should not be stored within a project directory. (And might cause issues with uploading your zip file)

Instead:

:::{.incremental}
- use a data version control service, 

- host the data online and download only the parts of it that are needed within your scripts,

- link in the documentation to where the full data may be downloaded (giving appropriate warning of the large file size)

# Making Information Palatable (5 mins)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Form as well as function? 

<br>

In the final few minutes, discuss the documents themselves (rather than their content).

How might the delivery of information impact on how it is recieved / acted upon? 

<br>

- How important is length?
- How important is presentation?
- Does your organisation have a similar document? 
- How does it compare?

# Discussion Points / Case Studies / Thought Experiments

## Predicting Pregnancy 

- What predictors / target variables do you feel should not be used in predictive models for targeted advertising?

```{r}

```

## Doorbell

Doorbell cameras are thing now. What if they offered personalised ringtones, depending who was at the door? 

- What issues might this present in terms of privacy and fairness?

- Which companies would you feel comfortable having this type of information about you? (And may already)

- How could this data be misused by the company or if leaked?

## Journo 

Suppose you used web scraping to collect public data of 100,000 social media users for you dissertation. 

A journalist asks for access to the data, promising not to make the content public. 

- Would you provide your data and / or code? 

- Would your answer change if it were a sociology lecturer writing a paper on digital communities?
