# Project Brief 

## What are you expected to do? 

<br>

> "For this assessment you will submit a piece of _reproducible data journalism_. This will be
published in a new magazine, to be launched as a competitor to [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/), and should
follow the [style guidelines](https://design-system.economist.com/documents/CHARTstyleguide_20170505.pdf) of The Economist.
>
> Your piece should be submitted as a file named `YOURCID-submission.pdf` and may take one
of two forms:
>
> - a single, full page (20x24cm) infographic;
> - an article of 200-300 words with 2-3 supporting data visualisations."

## What are New Scientist articles like? 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
<br>

- Present new findings and technical topics to a popular audience.

- Think interested final year high school student in a relevant field.

- Stories on topics which spark curiosity, encourage critical thinking and explore the societal implications of new findings.

## What do you mean by a full page infographic? 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
<br>
<br>

A single, complex data visualisation (or series of simpler visualisations combined into a single graphic) with a clear narrative flow, which might be provided by text or annotations within the graphic.

## What do you mean by article and supporting visualisations?

:::
:::{.column width="10%"}
:::
:::{.column width="40%"}
- 200-300 words + 2-3 supporting visualisations.

- Examples from a recent Economist magazine. 

- More complicated examples (typically, detailed maps) might be better suited to infographic style.

## Formatting 

<br>

> __Note 1:__ Submitted articles should be clearly presented but _final typesetting and arrangement will be controlled by the magazine’s editorial board_. To ensure high print quality, all figures should be provided as either vector graphics or with a resolution of least 300 dpi.


## What to write about? 

<br>

> __Note 2:__ Your submitted article or infographic should be based on a data set published on [data is plural archive](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/) between `2023-08-02` and `2023-12-06`. Each student must use a distinct data set; you should register your your CID against your chosen dataset in [this spreadsheet](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/zvarty_ic_ac_uk/EWZfAI0UVwROlLdSCRvBamcBQTYfyna06NrVIjkNpSm98g).

## Advice for Picking a Data Set 

<br>

:::{.incremental}
- Data quantity and quality vary, pick something that will let you show off your skills but is manageable in the time available. 

- Welcome to change your mind, that's why I picked 70 data sets. Just update spreadsheet in case someone else wants your current data.

- Think about how to tell a compelling story, this is easiest if the topic interests you.

# What do I submit? 

## Files to submit 

> You should submit two files in total for this assessment. 
>
>These files should be submitted via the Imperial College VLE on Blackboard by _13:00 on Wednesday 21 Feb 2024_. Note that large files
can take quite some time to upload. These files should be named:
>
> 1. `YOURCID-math70076-assessment-1.pdf`
> 2. `YOURCID-math70076-assessment-1.zip`
>
> Please ensure that you upload each document to the correct part of the learning space. Allowances will not be made for incorrect submission.

## Project Files: `YOURCID-math70076-assessment-1.zip` {.smaller}

<br>

>  This is a zipped folder containing the code, data, documentation, and anything else needed for the magazine team to reproduce your submission.
>
> This project folder should contain a file named `notes-to-editor.md`. This file should contain a reflective summary of how you have designed your submission and applied the style guide, addressing each of the following points in ∼ 100 words (300 words total):
> 
> :::{.incremental}
> - Summarise the style guidelines that are relevant to your submission;
> - Clearly state which guidelines are and are not met;
> - Describe any alterations you would make to your submission with the assistance of the magazine’s team of experienced data journalists.
